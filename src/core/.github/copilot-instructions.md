# Copilot Instructions for openapi-ui Project

ignore the /dist & /demo-dist directories, they are generated by the build process and should not be modified directly.
Don't use emojis in the code.
For terminal command use PowerShell.

## General JavaScript/UI Guidelines

- **STORAGE**: Use `localStorage` for storing user settings and API keys make sure to prefix keys with the {"info.title"\_"info.version"} property of the loaded OpenAPI specs as snake_case
- **Modularity**: Break functions into small, reusable ES files in `js/` which should be imported in standard HTML <script>.
- **DRY**: Abstract repeated code into `utils.js` or new files.
- **Async/Await**: Use `async/await` with `try/catch` for `fetch` and example generation.
- **Error Handling**: Always show clear error messages in the UI.
- **User notificatiosn**: use the global `window.utils.showToast(message, type)` to show user notifications, alerts, or the confirmation dialog.
  Examples
  - `window.utils.showToast('API key saved successfully', 'success')`
  - `window.utils.showToast('Error fetching data', 'error')`
  - `window.utils.showToast('Are you sure you want to delete this?', 'confirm')`

## CSS & Accessibility

- Consistent class naming (Tailwind ).
- Responsive layouts: test across breakpoints.
- Accessibility: use ARIA attributes and semantic HTML tags.

## CI / CD

When adding new js/css files make sure to update the build.js file to include them in the build process.
